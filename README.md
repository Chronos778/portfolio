# Maithil Patil - 3D Interactive Portfolio

A premium, immersive 3D developer portfolio built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP.

## About

Personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience as a Computer Science student specializing in Data Science and AI/ML. The site breaks away from traditional scrolling websites by offering a fully interactive WebGL 3D environment where visitors can smoothly navigate through my professional journey in a 3-dimensional space.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15+** - React framework with App Router
- **React 19** - Latest React with improved performance
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Three.js & React Three Fiber** - 3D rendering and scene management
- **@react-three/drei** - Useful helpers for R3F
- **GSAP** - Professional-grade smooth animations and camera transitions
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Vercel** - Seamless deployment and hosting

## Features

### 🎨 Immersive 3D Experience

- **Interactive Environment** - Navigate a 3D space instead of scrolling a 2D page.
- **Dynamic Camera Work** - GSAP-powered smooth camera panning and zooming between portfolio sections.
- **Custom 3D Models** - Includes imported glTF/GLB models to enhance the visual storytelling.
- **3D Typography** - Custom rendered 3D text (Soria and Vercetti fonts) integrated directly into the WebGL scene.

### � Showcased Sections

- **Hero** - A rotating 3D text tunnel displaying my core professional identities (Data Scientist, AI/ML Developer, Tech Optimist, Problem Solver, Innovator, Lifelong Learner).
- **Timeline** - A stylized 3D timeline tracing my educational and hackathon journey starting from B.Tech CSE (Data Science) graduation in 2024.
- **Interactive Projects Grid** - A beautiful sweeping 3D arc carousel displaying 11 of my GitHub repositories, including LifeTrack, Data Viz Playground, EcoGuard ML, and an array of Web/Software projects.

### 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First 3D** - The WebGL canvas dynamically recalculates field-of-view and camera positions to ensure the 3D scene looks just as good on mobile devices as it does on desktop.
- **Touch-Friendly Controls** - Custom `TouchPanControls` implemented for intuitive mobile navigation around the 3D space.
